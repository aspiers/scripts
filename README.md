Description
===========

This repository is a collection of tiny utility scripts, patches and hacks.

These are mostly one-time scripts, very old and very specific. I doubt you'll be able to use them as-is. Until you update and tweak them to fit your needs. In this case, don't hesitate to send me code and patches.

The code here is generally poorly written. Either because my coding style has improved since I wrote them, or because I didn't bother to make the code elegant after I finished my first working iteration.

If for any reason one of these script get momentum, I'll consider moving it to a stand-alone and dedicated project.
